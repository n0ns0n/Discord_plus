# Discord_plus
Discord on linux does not update it's self.

We do

Until now, the process was done manually by downloading and installing it.
So we created Discord_plus Project that enables the automatic Installation & Updates on Discord 
without any action/input of the user.

Feel free to use it and give us your opinion... 
We'll be glad to take your feedback in order to make it better. 



## Installation

Just a friendly advice 

If you have installed Discord via (.tar.gz) Package, you have to uninstall it manually before you run Discord_plus.


```git clone https://github.com/n0ns0n/Discord_plus $HOME/.local/share/Discord_plus && cd $HOME/.local/share/Discord_plus && bash install.sh```
